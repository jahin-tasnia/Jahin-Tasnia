## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate **MLOps Engineer** focused on building **agentic systems**, **machine learning pipelines**, and **intelligent applications** that bridge research and real-world impact.  
My current interests lie in **LangGraph**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines, and **LLM-based automation**, with a strong emphasis on system reliability, scalability, and explainability.

Beyond AI systems, I have a solid foundation in **competitive programming** and **full-stack development**, which allows me to design solutions that are both **algorithmically efficient** and **production-ready**.  
I enjoy integrating **backend engineering**, **cloud orchestration**, and **model deployment pipelines** into cohesive, automated MLOps workflows.

With a strong academic background and hands-on experience across diverse domains,  
I aim to push the boundaries of **explainable**, **trustworthy**, and **scalable** AI — one system at a time.
